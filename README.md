# Political Determinants of Lockdown Policy and State Economic Freedom in Brazil

We introduce a novel state-level measure of _lockdown regulatory freedom_ to study the severity of lockdowns for  Brazilian states and its determinants. Our main results show that lockdown policies were not consistently determined by any health-related variable, such as the number of doctors, hospital beds, the share of population with private health insurance, or the share of population 65 years of age and older or Covid-19 cases and deaths. Indeed, the only variable that was consistently related to lockdown policies in all specifications and robustness checks was the state's share of votes for the right-wing candidate. A one standard deviation increase in the share of votes for the right-wing candidate is associated with a 0.6-0.87 standard deviation increase in lockdown stringency.
